# Analyzing Unpredictability and Surprise in Text
To analyze unpredictability and "surprise" in text we calculated two entropy measures:

* Shannon Entropy (ShEn) as a global measure of unpredictability

* Approximate Entropy (ApEn) as a local measure of surprise (unpredictability in a specific context)

Using these two measures, we analyzed texts in three different text categories: canonical/fictional, non-canonical/fictional and  non-fictional texts.
We showed that canonical and non-canonical texts differ in sequential structure, while inter-genre differences (fictional vs. non-fictional) are a matter of the overall distribution of local
frequencies [1].


In another study [2], We showed that unpredictability and surprise analysis can differentiate between preferred and non-preferred texts in different time period (contemporary texts versus texts from the 19th and early 20th centuries). Preferred texts from both periods (contemporary bestsellers and canonical earlier texts) are characterized by higher degrees of unpredictability. However, preference in contemporary texts is reflected in global (text-level) distributions only (as measured with Shannon Entropy), while surprise in local distributions (as measured with Approximate Entropy) does not have an additional discriminating effect.
